# InFocus
Here, we present InFocus, an open-source, user-friendly, flexible and benchmarked model for fast vectorial analysis of the volumetric field distribution of light near the focus in any medium. The code corresponding to the freeware is written in MATLAB formalism. The spatial profile and the wavelength of the input beam can be set as arbitrary. The propagation is computed in up to two media (e.g. air and glass). The model accounts for aberrations induced by the focusing optics as well as eventual refractive index mismatch.
