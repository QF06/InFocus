# InFocus
Here, we present InFocus, which provides an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for fast vertorial analysis of the volumetic field distribution of the focused laser beam. It considers the lens induced spherical aberrations as well as the planar interface induced spherical aberrations.
