  abstract = {It is shown that when a lens produces an image of a point source the three-dimensional diffraction pattern which results is the three-dimensional Fourier transform of a generalization of the lens aperture. This implies similar Fourier relations in one and two dimensions. An explicit form of the former is derived which demonstrates that the amplitude distribution on an arbitrarily directed line through the focus is the Fourier transform of the projection of the generalized aperture onto that line. These relations hold in aberrant as well as in ideal systems. Some examples are worked out by using the one-dimensional relation.},

This generates a high intensity focal region with extremely high aspect ratio exceeding 10 000:1. The absence of intermediate focusing in the shaper allows for shaping very high energies, up to Joule levels. We demonstrate a proof of principle application of the Bessel beam shaper for stealth dicing of thick glass, up to 1 cm. We expect that this high energy Bessel beam shaper will have applications in several areas of high intensity laser physics.},

In a strong focusing geometry, a first damage zone is followed by a narrow track with submicron width, indicating a filamentary propagation.

The relative role of avalanche and photoionization is studied.

In addition to focusing in a single medium, the method is able to calculate the more complex case of focusing through a planar interface between two media of mismatched refractive indices. The use of the chirp z-transform in our numerical implementation of the method allows us to perform fast calculations of the three-dimensional focused field distribution with good accuracy.},
