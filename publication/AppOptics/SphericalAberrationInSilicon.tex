\begin{abstract}
	In-bulk processing of materials by laser radiation has largely evolved over the last decades and still opens up new scientific and industrial potentials. The development of any in-bulk processing application relies on the knowledge of laser propagation and especially the volumetric field distribution near the focus. Many commercial programs can simulate this, but, in order to adapt them, or to develop new methods, one usually needs to create a specific software. %Besides, people also need to know the actual field distribution near the focus to evaluate their assumptions in the simulation. 
	Besides, most of the time people also need to measure the actual field distribution near the focus to evaluate their assumptions in the simulation. To easily get access to this knowledge, we present our high-precision field distribution measuring method and release our in-house software InFocus \cite{InFocus}, under the Creative Commons 4.0 License. Our measurements provide 300-nm longitudinal resolution and diffraction limited lateral resolution. The in-house software allows fast vectorial analysis of the focused volumetric field distribution in the bulk. The simulations of light propagation under different conditions (focusing optics, wavelength, spatial shape, propagation medium) are in excellent agreement with propagation imaging experiments. The aberrations provoked by the refractive index mismatch as well as those induced by the focusing optics are both taken into account. The results indicate that our proposed model is suitable for the precise evaluation of energy deposition.
	%  And the in-house software allows fast vectorial analysis of the focused volumetric field distribution in the bulk. It considered the lens induced spherical aberrations as well as the planar interface induced spherical aberrations. The simulations and measurements are systematically compared.

\section{Introduction}\label{section:1}

In the last two decades, laser processing in the bulk of optical materials has attracted intensive attention in a wide range of academic researches and industrial engineering. In-volume laser direct writing enables precise three-dimensional structuring and has allowed many innovative applications that include the fabrication of channels \cite{bellouard2004fabrication, osellame2007integration, maselli2009femtosecond, he2010direct}, waveguides \cite{davis1996writing, chambonneau2016writing, pavlov2017femtosecond, gebremichael2020double,wang2020nanosecond}, gratings \cite{chambonneau2018inscribing}, data storage \cite{zhang2014seemingly}, and photonics quantum gates \cite{crespi2011integrated, lammers2019embedded}. The nature of the in-bulk processing also innovates new manufacturing procedures such as bonding \cite{richter2016laser,zhang2017interface, Cvecek2019, penilla2019ultrafast, Chambonneau2020} and dicing \cite{Meyer2019} of brittle materials. Among all potential applications, the precise description and control of the laser focusing and the energy deposition are crucial. Numerous experimental and theoretical investigations on the laser propagation and the energy absorption have been intensively carried out \cite{Couairon2007, berge2007ultrashort, gamaly2013generation,fedorov2016accessing, sahoo2020dynamic}. %Depending on the optical power, the combined effects of diffraction, nonlinear refraction, nonlinear absorption and plasmas formation leads to large variety of spatial and temporal effects \cite{couairon2007femtosecond} ranging from self-focusing/defocusing self phase modulation to the formation of solitons \cite{stegeman1999optical}. 

The propagation of the electromagnetic (EM) field can be rigorously described by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method \cite{liu2000three}, however in general it requires significant computational resources. Considerable effort has been devoted to designing propagation equations that on one hand preserve their computational simplicity and on the other hand preserve the correct description of nonparaxial and vectorial effects. In the nonlinear propagation regime, only until recently, the unidirectional Hertz vector propagation equation (UHPE) \cite{couairon2015propagation, PhysRevE.100.033316} was derived to provide a seamless transition from Maxwellâ€™s equations to the various envelope-based models, which considerably reduces the computational time. Simulations of the UHPE, require starting from input conditions, i.e., from the Hertz vector in a plane $z = z_0$. When the focusing elements have a high numerical aperture (NA), the input conditions are then determined by a phase correction to the field that simulates the action of the focusing element. The input conditions for the UHPE were constructed by a detailed calculation of diffraction by vectorial diffraction integrals (VDIs) \cite{varga2000focusing1,varga2000focusing2}, i.e. the linear propagation model. However, even though the vectorial effects have been considered by VDIs, the residual aberrations of the focusing elements are often ignored, which leads to a deviation from the correctness in the real laser processing conditions.

% sa number of alternative solutions are used to reduce the computational cost of Maxwell's solvers. One alternative is UPPE, if only consider linear propagation, DW intregral.   rely on the unidirectional pulse propagtion equation (UPPE) is recently reported to reduce the computational cost of Maxwell's solvers \cite{shipilo2019tight}. ultrashort laser pulses in bandgap material is given by the evolution of the optical field which follows the form of the scalar nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation  \cite{Sudrie2002}. Under this approximation, the laser beam is assumed remaining linearly polarized and the aberrations are often ignored. This assumption is valid when the laser is focused through a relatively low numerical aperture (NA < 0.6) into the low-refractive-index (< 1.5) materials with swallow depths (< 1-mm). However, when the laser is focused into the deep bulk of high-refractive-insdex material such as silicon, aberration induced by the interface must be considered. If high numerical aperture lens is used, polarization near the focus also turns to be complex. And in some cases, the focal lens would also introduced extra aberrations. In those conditions, using paraxial approximation would lead large deviation. 
The purpose of this work is to accurately describe these input conditions by taking into account all the potential aberrations that may occur in the laser in-bulk focusing, and to allow for a fast analysis with a proper transformation of the VDIs. 

One of the most widely used integral for analyzing the vectorial diffraction is the Debye-Wolf integral. As demonstrated by Leutenegger \emph{et~al.} \cite{leutenegger2006fast}, the 3D vectorial field distribution at the focus can be computed plane by plane under a proper transformation of the original Debye-Wolf integral. At a given axial position, the EM field in this plane is obtained by a two-dimensional Fourier transform. Lin \emph{et~al.} \cite{Lin2012} have also demonstrated that this method is applicable to focusing through an interface between two media of mismatched refractive index. In this paper, we further adapt this method to the real lens conditions and provide a fast analysis tool for the evaluation of the actual EM field distribution at the focus of the lens whose residual aberrations cannot be neglected. Meanwhile, a non-destructive experimental method is introduced to provide 300-nm longitudinal and diffraction limited lateral resolution measurements of the in-bulk volumetric intensity distribution. Our numerical methods are benchmarked with experiments relying on propagation imaging under various conditions (focusing optics, wavelength, spatial shape, propagation medium).
%In this paper, under the linear propagation condition, we are aiming to provide the electromagnetic (EM) field evolution by taking all the above mentioned extreme conditions into account. The results in this paper can easily adape to the nonlinear models and used as an initial condition for any nonlinear propagation investigating.  




\section{Model descriptions} \label{section:2}
\subsection{Three-dimensional Fourier Transform (3D-FT) representation of the field vectors near the focus}
Using the form developed by Richards and Wolf \cite{richards1959electromagnetic}, the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$) in the image regime of a system can be expressed by \eqref{eq:1}. Here $\mathbf{e}$ and $\mathbf{h}$ are the time-independent electric and magnetic vectors, $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathbf{E}(x, y, z, t)&=\Re\{\mathbf{e}(x, y, z)e^{-i\omega t}\},\\
		\mathbf{H}(x, y, z, t)&=\Re\{\mathbf{h}(x, y, z)e^{-i\omega t}\}.
	\end{aligned}	
\end{equation}
At any point $\textbf{P}(x,y,z)$ in the image space, the electric and magnetic vectors $\mathbf{e}$ and $\mathbf{h}$ can be expressed in the form as a summation of the plane waves that are leaving the aperture:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}\label{eq:2}
		\textbf{e}(x, y, z)&=-\frac{ik}{2\pi}\iint_\Omega\frac{\textbf{a}(s_x, s_y)}{s_z}e^{ik[\textbf{$\Phi$}(s_x, s_y)+s_xx+s_yy+s_zz]}\,ds_x\,ds_y,\\
		\textbf{h}(x, y, z)&=-\frac{ik}{2\pi}\iint_\Omega\frac{\textbf{b}(s_x, s_y)}{s_z}e^{ik[\textbf{$\Phi$}(s_x, s_y)+s_xx+s_yy+s_zz]}\,ds_x\,ds_y
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\Phi}(s_x, s_y)$ is the aberration function describing the optical path difference between the aberrated and the spherical wavefront along $\mathbf{s}$. Here $\mathbf{s}$ is a unit vector pointing from a point in the exit aperture to the focus, $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are the electric and magnetic strength vectors of the unperturbed electric and magnetic fields in the exit aperture, $k$ is the wave number, and $\Omega$ is the solid angle formed by all the geometrical optical ray. The phase factor shown in \eqref{eq:2} contains two parts, one is the scalar product of vector $\mathbf{s}$ and vector $\mathbf{r}_p$, another is the vectorial aberration function. In this section henceforth we only discuss the electric field since, apart from the strength vector, the two equations in \eqref{eq:2} are identical. 

Now let us consider a laser in-bulk focusing scenario. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}, after the focusing element, this configuration consists of materials 1 and 2 with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{vectorDiffractionTheory.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram showing laser focused by a lens into two media separated by a planar interface.}\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

In material 1 and at the interface ($z=-d$), the electric field is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
	\begin{aligned}
		\textbf{e}_1(x,y,-d)&=-\frac{ik_1}{2\pi}\iint_\Omega\textbf{C}(\vec{\mathbf{s}})\\
	&\times\exp[ik_1(s_{1x}x+s_{1y}y-s_{1z}d)]\,ds_{1x}\,ds_{1y}	
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
	\textbf{C}(\vec{\mathbf{s}})=\frac{\textbf{a}(s_{1x},s_{1y})e^{ik_1\Phi(s_{1x},s_{1y})}}{s_{1z}}
\end{equation}\label{eq:4}
by combining the strength vector $\mathbf{a}(s_{1x},s_{1y})$ and the aberration phase factor $e^{ik\Phi(\vec{\mathbf{s}})}$ into the new complex strength vector $\textbf{C}(\vec{\mathbf{s}})$. The remaining phase factor in \eqref{eq:3} thus contains only the scalar product of vector \textbf{s} and vector \textbf{r}$_p$.

Since there is no optical coating for all the cubical materials presented in this paper, we assume that each plane wave components refraction at the interface obeys the Fresnel equations. To determine the transmitted field in the second material, we also assume that the field in the second material is constructed by the superposition of refracted plane waves. As the complex strength vector of the plane wave upon the interface is described as $\textbf{C}(\vec{\textbf{s}})$, the strength vector of the transmitted plane wave can be described as a linear function of $\textbf{C}(\vec{\textbf{s}})$, i.e, $\textbf{T}\cdot\textbf{C}(\vec{\textbf{s}})$, where $\mathbf{T}$ is a refraction operator which is a function of angle of incidence and $n_1$, $n_2$. Therefore, the transmitted field in the second material can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
	\begin{aligned}
		\textbf{e}_2(x,y,-d)&=-\frac{ik_1}{2\pi}\iint_{\Omega_1}\textbf{T}\cdot\textbf{C}(\vec{\textbf{S}})\\
		&\times\exp[ik_1(s_{1x}x+s_{1y}y-s_{1z}d)]\,ds_{1x}\,ds_{1y}		
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, as T\"or\"ok \emph{et~al.} \cite{torok1995electromagnetic} suggested, we can also represent the field in the second material again as superposition of plane waves, which is a solution of time-dependent wave equation and can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
	\textbf{e}_2(\textbf{r}_p)=-\frac{ik_2}{2\pi}\iint_{\Omega_2}\textbf{F}(\vec{\mathbf{s}_2})\exp(ik_2\vec{\textbf{s}}_2\cdot\mathbf{r}_p)\,ds_{2x}\,ds_{2y}.
\end{equation}
One can notice that \eqref{eq:5} is the boundary condition of \eqref{eq:6}. Let us now establish the relation between $\vec{\textbf{s}_1}$ and $\vec{\textbf{s}_2}$.

According to the law of refraction,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
	k_1(\vec{\textbf{u}}\times\vec{\textbf{s}_1})=k_2(\vec{\textbf{u}}\times\vec{\textbf{s}_2}),
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\textbf{u}}$ is the unit vector that is normal to the interface. When a planar interface is presented $\vec{\textbf{u}}=(0,0,1)$, and we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
	k_1s_{1x}=k_2s_{2x},\,\,\,\,
	k_1s_{1y}=k_2s_{2y}.
\end{equation} 
By taking the coordinate transformation, \eqref{eq:6} yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:9}
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathbf{e}_2(\mathbf{r}_p)&=-\frac{ik_2}{2\pi}\iint_{\Omega_1}\mathbf{F}(\vec{\mathbf{s}_2})\\
		&\times\exp(ik_2\vec{\mathbf{s}_2}\cdot\vec{\mathbf{r}_p})\mathbf{J}_0(s_{1x},s_{1y};s_{2x},s_{2y})\,ds_{1x}\,ds_{1y},		
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{J}_0$ is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation obtained from \eqref{eq:8}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:10}
	\mathbf{J}_0=\left(\frac{k_1}{k_2}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
As \eqref{eq:9} must satisfy the boundary condition represented by \eqref{eq:5}, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:11}
	\mathbf{F}(\vec{\mathbf{s}_1},\vec{\mathbf{s}_2})=(\frac{k_2}{k_1})\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{C}(\vec{\mathbf{s}})\exp[id(k_2s_{2z}-k_1s_{1z})].
\end{equation}

By substituting \eqref{eq:11} into \eqref{eq:9} we obtain the electric field in the second material:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}\label{eq:12}
	\mathbf{e}_2(x,y,z)&=-\frac{ik^2_2}{2\pi k_1}\iint_{\Omega_1}\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{C}(\vec{\mathbf{s}})\\
	&\times\exp[id(k_2s_{2z}-k_1s_{1z})]\exp(ik_2s_{2z}z)\\
	&\times\exp[ik_1(s_{1x}x+s_{1y}y)]\,ds_{1x}\,ds_{1y}.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The first phase factor $\exp[id(k_2s_{2z}-k_1s_{1z})]$ stands for the aberration induced by the interface. The second phase factor $\exp(ik_2s_{2z}z)$ accounts for the phase accumulation when propagating along the z-axis, and the third term $\exp[ik_1(s_{1x}x+s_{1y}y)]$ represents the phase difference of the wave front at off-axis points (x, y, z) with respect to the on-axis point (0, 0, z).
Depending on the chosen coordinates, the following forms of the wave vectors are equivalent:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:13}
	\begin{aligned}
		&\vec{k_1}=\begin{pmatrix}
			k_{1x}\\
			k_{1y}\\
			k_{1z}
		\end{pmatrix}=k_1	
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-s_{1x}\\
			-s_{1y}\\
			s_{1z}	
		\end{pmatrix}=k_1
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-\sin\phi_1\cos\theta\\
			-\sin\phi_1\sin\theta\\
			\cos\phi_1	
		\end{pmatrix},\,\,\\\\
	&\vec{k_2}=\begin{pmatrix}
		k_{2x}\\
		k_{2y}\\
		k_{2z}
	\end{pmatrix}=k_2	
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-s_{2x}\\
			-s_{2y}\\
			s_{2z}	
		\end{pmatrix}=k_2
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-\sin\phi_2\sin\theta\\
			-\sin\phi_2\cos\theta\\
			\cos\phi_2	
		\end{pmatrix}.		
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore, $\,ds_{1x}\,ds_{1y}$ can be written as $\,dk_{1x}\,dk_{1y}/k_1^2$ and the interface-induced aberration can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:14}
	\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)=d(n_2\cos\phi_2-n_1\cos\phi_1).
\end{equation}
The spherical-polar form of the complex strength vector after the interface is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:15}
	\mathbf{C}(\phi_1,\phi_2,r,\theta)=\mathbf{T}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)\cdot\mathbf{a}(r,\theta)e^{ik_1\Phi(r,\theta)}/\cos\phi_1.
\end{equation}
By using $\mathbf{c}(\phi_1,\phi_2,r,\theta)$ to brief note $\mathbf{T}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)\cdot\mathbf{a}(r,\theta)e^{ik_1\Phi(r,\theta)}$, \eqref{eq:12} can be finally rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}\label{eq:16}
		\mathbf{e}_2(x,y,z,d)&=-\frac{ik^2_2}{2\pi k^3_1}
		\iint_{r<R}[\mathbf{c}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)e^{ik_0\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)}e^{ik_{2z}z}/\cos\phi_1]\\
		&\times \exp[-i(k_{1x}x+k_{1y}y)]\,dk_{1x}\,dk_{1y}.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

By using the method developed by Leutenegger \emph{et~al.} \cite{leutenegger2006fast}, we set $|\mathbf{c}|=0$ when $r>R$, the Debye-Wolf intergral is now expressed as the Fourier transform of the field distribution after the interface formed by the two material, ultimately resulting in
\begin{equation}\label{eq:17}
	\mathbf{e}_2(x,y,z,d)=-\frac{ik^2_2}{2\pi k^3_1}\mathcal{F}[\mathbf{c}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)e^{ik_0\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)}e^{ik_{2z}z}/\cos\phi_1].
\end{equation}

As inspired by Leutenegger \emph{et~al.} \cite{leutenegger2006fast}, we used the chirped Z-transform (CZT) algorithm \cite{Bakx2002} for the Fourier transformation. This algorithm (i) allows breaking the relationship between the sampling points (M) over the aperture radius and the minimal sampling points (N) for fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) enables an implicit frequency offset, and (iii) internalizes the zero padding. Applying this generalization, one can adapt the sampling step in the focus field independently of the sampling step in the input field, introduce an additional shift of the region of interest, and finally improve the computational efficiency.

% The Jacobian of the transformation to spherical polar coordinate is 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:17}
% 	\mathbf{J}_p=\sin\phi_1\cos\phi_2;
% \end{equation}
% therefore
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:18}
% 	ds_{1x}ds_{1y}=\sin\phi_1\cos\phi_1d\phi_1d\theta.
% \end{equation}
% and equation \eqref{eq:12} expressed as
% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{aligned}\label{eq:19}
% 	\mathbf{e}_2(\mathbf{r}_p,d)&=-\frac{ik_1}{2\pi}\iint_{\Omega_1}\frac{\mathbf{c}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)}{\cos\phi_1}\cos\phi_1\\
% 	&\times\exp[ik_0d(n_2\cos\phi_2-n_1\cos\phi_1)]\\
% 	&\times\exp\{ik_2r_p[\sin\phi_2\sin\phi_p\cos(\theta-\theta_p)+\cos\phi_2\cos\phi_p]\}\sin\phi_2d\phi_2d\theta.
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% Let's define that 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
% 	\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)=d(n_2\cos\phi_2-n_1\cos\phi_1),
% \end{equation}
% and 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
% 	\mathbf{C}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)=\mathbf{c}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)\delta(\rho-k_1),	
% \end{equation}
% equation \eqref{eq:19} can be written as the following triple integral
% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{aligned}\label{eq:22}
% 		\mathbf{e}_2(\mathbf{r}_p,d)&=-\frac{i}{2\pi k_1}\\
% 		&\times\int^{2\pi}_0\int^\pi_0\int^\infty_0[\mathbf{C}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)]\\
% 		&\times\exp\{ik_2r_p[\sin\phi_2\sin\phi_p\cos(\theta-\theta_p)+\cos\phi_2\cos\phi_p]\}\rho^2\sin\phi_2\,d\phi_2\,d\theta\,d\rho.
% 	\end{aligned}		
% \end{equation}
% According to McCutchen's method \cite{McCutchen:64} equation \eqref{eq:22} is the three-dimensional Fourier transform (3D-FT) of $[\mathbf{C}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\theta)\Psi(\phi_1,\phi_2,d)]$. In other words, explicitly driven from Debye-Wolf intergral, the transmitted field in the second material is the 3D-FT of the product of strength vector after the interface and an aberration function. In practise, after transformation to Cartesian coordinate, using FFT algorithm can result in an output plane with the same transverse dimension and sampling size as the aperture. By using Leutenegger's method, 
% \begin{equation}
% 	\mathbf{e}_2(x,y,z,d)=-
% \end{equation}

\subsection{Representation of the complex strength vector}
To determine the complex strength vector $\mathbf{c}$, let us assume that the incident field is linearly polarized. By choosing the corresponding Cartesian coordinate and letting the y- and z-components of the incident electric field as zero, the incident electric strength vector can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:18}
	\mathbf{E}^{(0)}=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		E_0\\
		0\\
		0
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

According to T\"or\"ok \emph{et~al.} \cite{torok1995electromagnetic}, the transform relation betweeen the incident vector and the refracted vector after the interface can be expressed by a refraction operator $\mathbf{T}$. This operator has a matrix form of 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:19}
		\mathbf{T}=A(\phi_1)
		\begin{bmatrix}
			a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\
			a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\
			-a_{13} & a_{23} & a_{33}
		\end{bmatrix}.
	\end{equation}	
with
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		a_{11} &= \tau_p\cos^2\theta\cos\phi_2+\tau_s\sin^2\theta,\\
		a_{12} &= (\tau_p\cos\phi_2-\tau_s)\cos\theta\sin\theta,\\
		a_{13} &= \tau_p\cos\theta\sin\phi_2,\\
		a_{22} &= \tau_s\cos^2\theta+\tau_p\cos\phi_2\sin^2\theta,\\
		a_{23} &= \tau_p\sin\theta\sin\phi_2,\\
		a_{33} &= \tau_p\cos\phi_2,\\	
	\end{aligned}	
\end{equation*}
where $\tau_s$ and $\tau_p$ are the Fresnel transmission coefficients for s-polarized and p-polarized light, respectively. The function $A(\phi_1)$ is an apodization function that depends on the lens. Moreover when the system obeys Abbe's sine condition, i.e, is aplanatic, then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
	A(\phi_1)=f l_0\sqrt{\cos\phi_1}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the focal length of the lens in vacuum and $l_0$ is an amplitude factor. It is assumed that the Abbe's sine condition is verified in this step, as it is usually fullfiled in a corrected microscopic lens or in a single spherical lens with the stop located at the lens.

To represent the aberration phase factor and to scale it in wavelength $\lambda$, the aberration factor $e^{ik_1\Phi(r,\theta)}$ is rewritten as $e^{i2\pi W(r,\theta)}$. To describe a circular lens-induced wavefront aberration and calculate the deviation of the wavefront from an ideal spherical shape, one widely used method relies on the Zernike polynomials.  %In this paper, we use the notation convention defined by R. Noll \cite{Noll1976}.
% For spherical lens, the primary aberrations can be represented by the Seidel formula. The aberration function $W$ can be written as:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 	W&=W_{040}r^4+W_{131}yr^3\cos\theta_0+W_{222}y^2r^2\cos^2\theta_0\\
% 	&+W_{220}y^2r^2+W_{311}y^3r\cos\theta_0
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% where $W_{040}$ and so on are the Seidel coefficients, $r$ is the normalized aperture radius on the entrance pupil plane, $y$ is the field height and $\theta_0$ is the pupil azimuth angle. It is worth to note that, in Seidel aberration, only primary aberration is considered. And for most of the in-bulk laser processing condition, the laser beam is normal incident to the lens, and the chief ray is along the optical axis. Therefore, only the on-axis spherical aberration play significant role and the off-axis aberration can be ignored. The aberration function can be simplified as 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:22}
% 	W=W_{040}r^4.
% \end{equation}

By using the vendors provided lens data, the aberration function can be calculated in the form of superposition of Zernike polynomials through any homemade ray tracing program or commercial software such as Zemax or Code V. In this paper, we used Zemax \cite{Zemax} to calculate the aberration function and used the notation convention defined by Noll \cite{Noll1976} (so-called Zernike standard polynomials):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:22b}
	W = \sum_{i=1}^{37}c_iZ_i(\rho,\theta_0),
\end{equation}
where $c_i$ is the orthonormal Zernike coefficient computed by Zemax, $Z_i$ is the corresponding Zernike standard polynomial and dimensionless radius $\rho = r/r_{max}$ normalized to the radius of the entrance pupil.

Finally, from \eqref{eq:15}, \eqref{eq:18} and \eqref{eq:22b}, the complex strength vector after the interface can be written as:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}\label{eq:23}
			\mathbf{c}&=f l_0\sqrt{\cos\phi_1}\\
			&\times\begin{bmatrix}
				a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\
				a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\
				-a_{13} & a_{23} & a_{33}
				\end{bmatrix}
				\begin{bmatrix}
					e^{i2\pi W}&0&0\\
					0&e^{i2\pi W}&0\\
					0&0&e^{i2\pi W}
				\end{bmatrix}
				\begin{bmatrix}
					E_0\\
					0\\
					0
				\end{bmatrix}.
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}	

By substituting \eqref{eq:23} into \eqref{eq:12}, a CZT algorithm based highly-efficient propagation model is complete, it allows fast in-focus fields calculation by taking into account both the lens-induced and interface-induced aberrations.

\section{Experimental arrangement}
\subsection{ Propagation imaging}
Propagation imaging methods have been widely used to investigate the linear or nonlinear optical effects in a medium \cite{pasquier2015handling, fedorov2016accessing, wang2020ultrafast,Chambonneau2020}. In this paper, to have a systematic comparison with the numerical results, we introduce non-destructive measurements on the in-bulk volumetric intensity distributions which rely on (i) the focusing of the laser beam at the exit surface of the sample with desired thickness, and (ii) an inverted microscope working in transmission for imaging the beam profile in the \textit{xy} plane for various positions of the focusing objective along the propagation direction \textit{z}. The experimental set-up is schematically depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{setup.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of in-bulk propagation imaging process. (a) Experimental setup, MO: microscope objective, ND: neutral density filters. (b) Intensity distribution near the focal region reconstructed from the stack of recorded images.}\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

The measurements can be explicitly divided into two steps. The first step consista in focusing the laser beam with identical characteristics (beam size, spectrum, phase distribution, etc.) as in the simulations. Here, we have chosen a femtosecond pulse laser to avoid the parasitic interference caused by residual multiple reflections. In this ultrashort pulse regime, before focusing, the pulse energy is kept low (typically, a few tens of picojoules) to avoid nonlinear propagation effects. The second step consists in imaging the exit surface of the sample with the inverted microscope working in transmission along the z-axis. This microscope is composed of an infinity-corrected objective lens whose NA is larger than that of the focusing elements, a tube lens and an image sensing array. In this paper, the NA of the imaging objective lens is 0.85 and its focal plane is precisely adjusted at the exit surface of the sample under white light illumination with a translation stage. When there is no sample (focus in air), this plane can be arbitrarily chosen. Thanks to a precision stage (Physik Instrumente, M-126DC1), the laser intensity evolution along the z-axis is recorded by alternating 100-nm movements of the focus lens (corresponding to $n\times100$-nm displacement in a sample with refractive index of $n$), and image acquisitions by the camera. The stack of images is then post-processed for reconstructing the fluence distribution as follows. Firstly, due to the jitter of the laser, some recorded images may show a much higher maximum intensity compare to both the preceding and the following one. These rare outlier images are replaced by the average of the preceding and the following images. Then, in the corner of each image, the noise is calculated as the average of the pixel amplitude, and subsequently subtracted from all pixels. The image containing the maximum gray level is used for the normalization of the whole stack. Two images before and after this latter image are defined for evaluating and correcting the residual tilt of the collecting objective lens with respect to the incoming beam. Finally, the beam propagation is reconstructed by displaying a cross-section (along x or y) of each image at the center of the beam. 

To demonstrate the universality of our method, propagation imaging experiments have been carried out with four different focusing elements and two laser platforms. The first platform is based on an erbium-doped fiber laser (Raydiance Inc, Smart Light 50) with a wavelength $\lambda$ of 1555 nm and a pulse duration of 860 fs. The second one is based on a prototype TRUMPF TruMicro 2030 Femto Edition laser with a wavelength $\lambda$ of 1030 nm and a pulse duration of 265 fs. The average power stability of both lasers is < 1\%. 

\subsection{Materials}
Two singlet lenses (Thorlabs, LA1951-C and C240TME-C) and a 50$\times$ microscope objective lens (Mitutoyo, Apo NIR) are tested with the Raydiance laser platform. The radius of the input Gaussian beam profile is 5.2-mm (at $1/e^2$). A 20$\times$ microscope objective (Mitutoyo, Apo NIR) is tested with the TruMicro 2030 platform, the input beam profiles are shaped through amplitude modulation (slit) or phase modulation (phase plate). To represent the residual aberrations of the two singlet lenses, the nonzero terms of the Zernike standard coefficients are calculated according to our experimental conditions and listed in the Appendix A (Table~\ref{tab:A1}). The laser beams are focused in air ($n$=1) and in crystalline silicon (c-Si, $n$=3.475 at $\lambda$=1555~nm). Detailed information on the materials used in the experiment are listed in Table \ref{tab:1}.

\section{Results and discussions} \label{section:3}
In this section we systematically compare our numerical results with the experiments. Under the in-air focus condition, the experimental results benchmarked our numerical model. The further numerical investigations of the in-silicon focus condition, in return, pointed out a limitation of the experimental method.

\subsection{Gaussian beam focused by an aspheric lens in air}
To achieve in-bulk processing, tightly focused laser beams are often required. A cost-efficient solution to get the diffraction-limited high quality tight focusing is to use an aspheric lens. %However, it is worth noting that a single aspheric lens is also not aplanatic, the higher order aberrations should be considered.
%the converging waves after the exit pupil are not fit to the spherical wave approximation used in Debye-Wolf integral. Even this deviation can be ignored under the conditions when a collimated light is normally incident to a low NA lens, extra caution should be taken when the appling conditions varied.} 
In this paper, an aspheric lens (Thorlabs C240TME-C) with NA = 0.5 is used for the first demonstration. As the $1/e^2$ radius of the input beam is 5.2-mm, the lens is overfilled by a factor of 1.3. Therefore, to calculate the aberrations induced by this lens, the apodization factor $G$ (refers to the rate of decrease of the beam amplitude as a function of radial pupil coordinate) is set as $\sqrt{1/1.3}$, i.e., 0.877. The amplitude is normalized to unity at the center of the pupil, and on the other points of the entrance pupil the amplitude is given by $A(\rho)=e^{-G\rho^2}$, where $\rho$ is the normalized pupil coordinate. Under this approximation, the aberrations induced by the lens are calculated and represented by the standard Zernike coefficients. The nonzero coefficients up to the 37th term are listed in Appendix A, Table~\ref{tab:A1}. As a first demonstration, the focused-in medium is air and the corresponding refractive index is 1. Based on \eqref{eq:17} and \eqref{eq:23}, the normalized intensity distribution near the focus is calculated and presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(c-d). By applying the method presented in section~\ref{section:2}(A), the corresponding experimental results are obtained and presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(a-b).  
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{C240TME-C.pdf}
	\caption{Intensity distribution near the focus of an aspherical lens in air with a Gaussian beam as the input. (a) Experimentally measured intensity along $xz$ plane; (b) experimentally measured intensity at the focal plane; (c) simulated intensity along $xz$ plane; (d) simulated intensity at the focal plane. (e) Comparison of the intensity profiles at the focal plane along the x-axis, (f) along the z-axis.}\label{fig:3b}
\end{figure}
The normalized longitudinal intensity distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(a) and (c), and the intensity distributions at the focal plane are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(b) and (d). The overall distributions are very similar. To quantitatively evaluate how good the simulation results fit with the experimental one, the normalized experimental intensity profiles are compared to the simulated ones in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(e-f), together with the absolute values for the intensity difference. Based on these quantitative analyses, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of those two normalized intensities are calculated for each axis. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(e), by setting the intensity maximized position as the origin, the intensity profiles and their differences are plot from  -5~$\mu$m to 5~$\mu$m. The experimental beam width (at $1/e^2$) is measured as 2.64~$\mu$m, and the simulated one is 2.93~$\mu$m. In this transverse direction, the aforementioned RMSD is calculated as 0.0305. We applied the same methods to the results along the longitudinal direction. The normalized intensity profiles are compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}(f) along the z-axis. The RMSD of the longitudinal profiles is calculated as 0.0322. To anchor a reference, we also simulated the intensity distribution near the focus without considering the influence of the aberrations (not shown here). In this case, the RMSD of the normalized profiles along x, z-axis are 0.0382 and 0.0365. In other words, by taking the aberrations induced by the C240TME-C lens into account, the RMSDs have decreased by 20.2\% and 11.8\% along the x- and z-axis, respectively.

\subsection{Gaussian beam focused by a plano-convex lens in air}
The plano-convex lens is one of the simplest converging lenses that has been widely used to focus collimated light. The spherical aberrations can be minimized due to the asymmetric design by placing the curved surface face toward the collimated beam, however, it cannot be completely eliminated. In this demonstration, we choose a plano-convex lens (Thorlabs LA1951-C) with $f = 25.3~mm$ and used the two methods mentioned in Section \ref{section:2} and \ref{section:3} to evaluate the intensity distribution at its focus. The same collimated laser beam that was used in the previous section is focused by this lens in air. To calculate the lens-induced aberrations,
%the aperture type is set as 'Entrance Pupil Diameter' and its valus is set as 10.4-mm. \hl{The apodization factor $G$ (refers to the rate of decrease of the beam amplitude as a function of radial pupil coordinate) is set as 1. T
the beam amplitude is normalized to unity at the center of the pupil, at other points of the entrance pupil the amplitude is given by $A(\rho)=e^{-G\rho^2}$, where G = 4 and $\rho$ is the normalized pupil coordinate. Under this approximation, the aberrations induced by the lens are calculated and represented by the standard Zernike coefficients. In Appendix A, Table~\ref{tab:A1} the nonzero coefficients are listed up to the 37th term. Finally, the normalized intensity distribution near the focus is calculated based on \eqref{eq:17} and \eqref{eq:23} and presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(c-d). The corresponding experimental results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(a-b).

Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(a) and (c) show the normalized longitudinal intensity distributions and Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(b) and (d) shown the intensity distribution at the focal plane. To quantitatively evaluate the agreement, in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (e-f), we plot the normalized intensity value along the x and y central segment at the focal plane.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (e), along the x-axis, the experimental beam diameter at $1/e^2$ is measured as 10.6~$\mu$m and the simulated one is 11.4~$\mu$m. The RMSD of the two profiles is 0.051. Similar comparisons are applied to the profiles along the y-axis. The experimental beam width is measured as 11.3~$\mu$m, the simulated one is 11.4~$\mu$m and the RMSD is 0.046. From the quantitative comparison one can notice that, in contrast to the simulation results (d), the experimental ones (b) exhibit an elliptical feature. This deviation is due to the fact that for the simulations the incident beam has been oversimplified as a circular Gaussian beam. Apart from that, the simulated results fit well with the experiment. 

It is also worth noting that, given that the experimental results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (a) are composed by 6000 individual frames, on the left-hand side of this figure some frames are misaligned due to the environmental disturbance such as air flows and vibrations.    
%Due to the misalignment of the images stacking, we could not provide the RMSD of the longitudinal intensities. However, the overview of the longitudinal intensity distributions through the focal regime shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (a) (c) indicate simular positive spherical aberration features. The twisted tail on the left hand side of Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (a) is most probably caused by the difficulty of finding the image center during the post-processing. 
Except for that, one can notice that the aberration features as well as the overall lengths of the focal regime are identical.

Comparisons of the intensity profiles at the focal plane (e) along the x-axis; (f) along the y-axis.}\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Exotic beams focused by an objective lens in air}
Microscope objective lenses are also widely used for laser beam focusing and material processing. With a proper design, the aberrations can be well corrected for the design wavelength range. In this section, we choose a 20$\times$ Mitutoyo Plan Apo objective lens (NA = 0.4) as the focus lens. The center wavelength of the laser source is 1030-nm. Instead of using a standard Gaussian beam as the input, we choose amplitude- and phase-shaped beams for the investigation. To precisely simulate the focusing conditions, we first record the intensity profile of the exotic beams at the entrance pupil of the objectives with an array of image sensors, and then calculate the amplitude distribution by taking the square root of the intensity profile. Based on those measured ``user defined'' amplitude profiles and their polarization states, we obtain the complex fields on the entrance pupil. Finally, based on \eqref{eq:17} and \eqref{eq:23}, the fields near the focus can be calculated. These calculated intensity distributions are compared to the experimental results. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{20xairExotic.pdf}
	\caption{Intensity distribution of the input beam at the entrance pupil for (a) a Gaussian beam cut by a slit with a width of 1.38-mm, (h) a Gaussian beam accumulating a spiral phase (bottom). Intensity distributions near the focus: (b-d) (i-k) experimentally measured along $xz$, $yz$ and $xy$ plane; (e-g) (l-n) simulated along $xz$, $yz$ and $xy$ plane.}\label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

A circular cross-sectional focusing is often required for transversal writing of single-mode waveguides or microfluidic channels. Slit beam shaping is a simple technique that provides such an isotropic resolution in transverse and vertical direction \cite{cheng2003control, ams2005slit}. In this section, we use the slit beam shaping as a first example to prove that our methods are also applicable for the amplitude shaped beam. 

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} (a), a linearly-polarized Gaussian beam with a $1/e^2$ radius of 5.2~mm is cut by a 1.38-mm width slit. The experimentally measured intensity distributions obtained by focusing this beam are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}(b-d), and the simulated results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}(e-g). At the focal plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} (d), the beam width along the x-axis is measured as 2.9~$\mu$m and along the y-axis is 10.9~$\mu$m. These beam width values at the focal plane are identical to those obtained in the simulations in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}(g). Similarly, an excellent agreement between the experiments and the calculations is found in the $xy$ and the $yz$ planes, as shown in (b-c) and (e-f), respectively. As expected with such slit beam shaping, the light is focused tighter in the $xz$ plane than in the $yz$ plane. This mainly originates from the loss in the effective numerical aperture along the y-axis due to the fact that the input beam does not overfill the entrance pupil as for the x-axis.
%Comparing with the simulated results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} (g), the beam widths exhibit the same value. By comparing the longitudinal results (b-c) and (e-f), the presented experimental and simulated focusing features are consistent, i.e. at first the laser beam is less tightly focused in y-z plane compare to the one in x-z plane and secondly the axis of the intensity center is tilt against z-axis. These features can be explained as at first the input beam is deficient filled the entrance pupil along y-axis and overfilled along x-axis which leads a relatively low effective NA in y direction, and secondly the input laser beam profile is rather than a perfect Gaussian distribution but exhibits some asymmetrical features. It is worth noting that the second feature is revealed in the simulation results only when it allows to use the real intensity distribution at the entrance pupil as the input. 
All in all, a near-perfect agreement between the experimental measurements and the calculations demonstrates that our proposed model is a powerful tool even for investigating laser-matter interaction scenarios where sophisticated anisotropic beams are employed. 

However, one should be careful when applying our computational method under extremely asymmetric conditions such as the line-focus microscopy (LTM), as Wolf and Li have indicated that their Debye integral representation should be considered only beyond a critical value of the Fresnel number \cite{wolf1981conditions}. The Fresnel number is a dimensionless number, $\mathcal{N} = a^2/\lambda f$, which reflects the relative contribution of focusing against diffraction effects for a given aperture radius $a$, focal length $f$, and wavelength $\lambda$. For more rigorous approaches dedicated to this specific problem, one can refer to the works of De la Cruz \emph{et~al.} \cite{de2011modeling} and Lou \emph{et~al.} \cite{lou2018better}. They have illustrated that, for Fresnel numbers close to unity, the focus shifts backward, thus leading to astigmatic focusing when the circular symmetry of the input light is broken. In our case where $\mathcal{N}\approx 41$, such a backward shift could not be observed experimentally. %which explains why we could not observe this backward shift in the experiment and makes our simulation results acceptable.  

In the same way as we have studied the influence of amplitude shaping, the impact of phase shaping has also been investigated. Over the last decade, the helical wavefront is one of the most extensively studied complex phase shapes of light. This type of light beams have an azimuthal phase dependence of $\exp(il\theta)$, where $l$ is the topological charge and $\theta$ is the azimuth angle. The optical vortex has many innovative applications in optical tweezers \cite{padgett2011tweezers}, atom manipulation \cite{ladavac2004microoptomechanical} and material processing \cite{hnatovsky2010materials}. When focused, this optical vortex forms a ring instead of a spot in the focal plane. In this section, experimentally, we used a spiral phase plate (SPP) to discretely generate an azimuthal phase distribution of $\exp(-i\theta)$. The topological charge is -1, and the number of discrete steps is 12. After the phase plate, the laser beam is focused by the same 20$\times$ objective lens as previously. In the simulation, to obtain the corresponding complex field as the input, we multiplied the measured amplitude distribution with a discrete spiral phase map that exhibits the same phase distribution as the one used in the experiment. The measured input intensity distribution and the calculated spiral phase map are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} (h).

The simulations in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}(l-n) exhibit similar optical vortex features as the experimental measurements in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}(i-k). From the longitudinal intensity distributions (i-j) and (l-m) one can see that in both cases the light waves along the propagation axis cancel each other out and the ratios of the outer and inner radii are identical. At the focal plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} (k) and (n), this ratio is measured as 4.3 (experimental) and 4.0 (simulated). While, overall, the experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement, one can still note some deviations in the spot elliptically and the intensity homogeneity, most likely provoked by imperfections of the spiral phase plate as well as residual misalignments of this plate.
% However, even in general the results achieved by the two methods are identical, one can still notice some deviations in terms of the spot ellipticity and the intensity homogeneity. Those deviations are most probably due to the imperfection of the spiral phase plate and its misalignment to the central of the beam.          

\subsection{Gaussian beam focused by an objective lens in silicon}
In the previous sections, the laser beams are focused in air. In this section, the in-bulk focus condition is chosen. Unlike in the aforementioned conditions, large experimental to simulation deviation are observed in this scenario. These deviations can be ascribed to the experimental procedure to acquire the intensity profile. 

When a planar interface is present, according to the aberration function [\eqref{eq:14}] as well as noted in experimental observations \cite{li2016quantitative}, the interface-induced aberration is a function of the focus depth, the NA and the refractive index of the bulk material. By applying the same methodology as described above, we can achieve the experimental and simulated results of the longitudinal intensity distributions near the focus. When a Gaussian beam ($\lambda$: 1555-nm, $1/e^2$ radius: 5.2-mm) is focused into a 5-mm thick crystalline silicon (c-Si) sample ($n$ = 3.475 at 1555-nm) by an objective lens with NA of 0.65, the experimental result is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}(a) and the corresponding simulation is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}(b). Contrary to the previous cases, this comparison shows significant deviations, especially in terms of the overall length. The main reason for this deviation is that, given the employed propagation imaging measurements, the experimental results do not correspond to the intensity distribution at 5-mm focal depth, but it is the stacking of intensity profiles at the exit surface of the 5-mm thick sample for a focusing objective lens moved step-by-step from -1.5 to +0.5 mm (the position 0 corresponding to the exit surface). %in a bulk material this measured result is actually not the intensity distribution with a focal depth of 5-mm. Precisely speaking, it is the stacking of intensity profiles at the exit surface of the 5-mm sample while the focusing objective lens moved step-by-step from -1.5 to +0.5~mm refers to the exit surface. %To distinguish it from the real distribution in the bulk, Fig.~\ref{fig:5} (b-c) show the simulated distribution with focal depth of 4-mm and 5-mm, comparing with the experimental result, the 4-mm result has a similar overall length but the relative intensity of the right-hand side 'tail' is much lower, and the 5-mm result shows a longer overall distribution length.
\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{50xSi.pdf}
	\caption{Intensity distributions near the focus, (a) Experimentally measured intensity along $xz$ plane; (b) simulated intensity along $xz$ plane with focal depth of 5-mm; (c) simulated intensity at the exit surface of the 5-mm sample with focal depth varying from 3.5-mm to 5.5-mm.}\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

One could wonder why not directly measuring the intensity distribution in the bulk of the material. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to measure the real intensity distribution experimentally. This problem cannot be solved by fixing the position of the focusing objective lens and moving the recording microscope since, in this case, the recorded images would be strongly affected by the aberrations provoked by the refractive index mismatch at the back surface of the sample. %A spontaneous question raised here is 'why not directly measure the intensity distribution in the bulk?'. However, unfortunately, experimentally it is unlikely to measure the real intensity distribution. If we fix the position of the focusing objectives and move the recording microscope, the recorded images would also be affected by the depth related aberration during the step-by-step moving. 
The only way to avoid the artificial result is to compensate the depth related aberration after each movement. Considering 200 movements during one measurement, it is unrealistic to compensate it with any simple means such as a correction collar. However, the experimental result shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}(a) can still be exploited for benchmarking our model.

In order to carry out simulations in a situation that is comparable to the experiments, we first calculate the corresponding intensity profile at the exit surface of the 5-mm sample for different focal depths (from 3.5 to 5.5~mm). The focal depth increment step size is 5~$\mu$m. After the calculation, we stack the intensity profiles from the left to the right with the focus depth decrement from 5.5~mm to 3.5~mm. With these two steps, the experimental image acquisition procedure and the corresponding intensity distribution are simulated and displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}(c). While the comparison between the experiments (a) and the simulation for a fixed focus at 5-mm focal depth (b) is mediocre, the experiments and the simulated experiments (c) are in excellent agreement. %Compare to (b) and (c), it shows better similarity in terms of overall length and relative intensity along the profile to the experimental result (a).

One should emphasize that the simulation at 5-mm focal depth (c) corresponds to the real intensity distribution, which could not be measured experimentally in a simple way. If one aims at measuring the intensity distribution experimentally, extra attention must be paid to the potentially unrealistic character of the results.
%Therefore, when a laser beam is focused into a bulk material, to investigate the intensity distribution along the propagation direction, one should pay extra attention for the results that obtained by the experimental methods. 

To quantitatively illustrate the deviation of the experimental measured results and the actual in-bulk intensity distribution, we compare in Fig.~\ref{fig:6} the actual simulated intensity distribution for a fixed focal depth to the simulated experimental results for different numerical apertures and silicon thicknesses.
%and to get rid of the influence of the misalignment during the image frames acquisition, the simulated actual intensity distribution profile is plot against simulated experimental result, i.e. Fig~\ref{fig:5} (c) versus Fig~\ref{fig:5} (d). The normalized profile comparison is presented in Fig~\ref{fig:6} (b). The corresponding RMSD of this case is calculated as high as 0.113.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SEvsS.pdf}
	\caption{(a) The RMSDs of the simulated actual intensity distribution and the simulated experimental result under different NAs and focal depths. Comparison of the cross-section intensity profiles near the focus along the z-axis with (b) NA = 0.65 and focal depth of 5 mm; (c) NA = 0.4 and focal depth of 2.5 mm; (d) NA = 0.26 and focal depth of 1 mm.}\label{fig:6}
\end{figure}

Given that this deviation is caused by the aberrations induced by the planar interface of the bulk material, the focusing conditions (NA and focal depth) will determine how significant this deviation is. In order to illustrate this relationship and highlight the limitations of propagation imaging experiments, the RMSDs under different numerical apertures and sample thicknesses are calculated in Fig.~\ref{fig:6}(a). As shown in the 3D bar chart, this deviation becomes negligible for small numerical apertures and sample thicknesses. 
%when the NA of the objective lens or the focal depth decreased. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:6}(b-d) comparisons of the cross-section profiles along the z-axis are illustrated for three selected cases. When the NA is decreased to 0.26 and the focal depth is decreased to 1 mm, the experimentally measured results are almost identical to the actual in-bulk intensity distribution. The RMSD for this case is 0.009. This value is even smaller than the deviation of the experimental measured and simulated intensity distributions in air, for which there is no influence of the interface-induced aberration. Therefore, in this case, it is safe to use the propagation imaging measurements for representing the actual intensity distribution represent the actual intensity distribution and further apply this propagation imaging method for investigating more complex nonlinear propagation problems \cite{Chambonneau2020}.

%Besides, since in this demonstration the NA is as high as 0.65, even the incident beam is linear polarized along x-direction, the polarization near the focus will no longer be pure x-polarized. When the focal depth is set as 5-mm, the amplitude of the three polarization components near the focal regime is displaced in Fig.~\ref{fig:6}. At the plane where maximum total intensity is located, as shown by Fig \ref{fig:6} (a-c), the maximum amplitude of the x-component is about 457 times higher than the y-component and 34 times higher than the z-component. The maximum total intensity plane is overlapped with the maximum $|E_x|$ plane, however it shifts away from the maximum $|E_y|$ or $|E_z|$ plane for about 1140~$\mu$m. The maximum $|E_y|$ and $|E_z|$ planes are overlapped, and located at the right tail of the intensity profile shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5} (c). As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:6} (d-f), the maximum amplitude of $|E_x|$ at this plane is about 37 and 9 times higher than the maximum amplitude of $|E_y|$ and $|E_z|$, which is much lower compare to the maximum total intensity plane. This observation indicates that, when a linear polarized laser beam is focused into a bulk material by a high NA lens, it will not only generate new polarization components near the focus, the maximum amplitude planes of each components are also shifted.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a benchmarked model and an experimental tool for analyzing the field distribution when a laser beam is focused in air or in bulk materials. The vectorial analysis model considered the lens-induced as well as the planar interface-induced aberrations. The in-bulk propagation imaging setup provides a 300-nm longitudinal resolution and diffraction limited lateral resolution. Using the tools introduced in this paper, one can deal with a wide variety of focus conditions in which arbitrary input fields, non-aplanatic lenses, and in-bulk focus might be involved. 

While the numerical simulation tool is applicable, we have also pointed out that for high numerical apertures and significant focal depths, the experimental results acquired by propagation imaging methods that are similar to the one described in this paper might lead to large deviations against the actual intensity distribution in the desired focal depth. One should calculate the RMSD or at least check the RMSD chart before applying these methods to any linear or nonlinear propagation imaging experiments. 

We plan to continue the development of InFocus \cite{InFocus} in the spirit of open-source and would be pleased to find collaborators. We anticipate that our proposed model and corresponding software InFocus can be utilized in countless laser processing applications involving various wavelengths, beam shapes, phase distributions and focusing optics.
%As an application example in the field of laser in-bulk processing, one can use our tools to calculate the aberration free condition in which the spherical aberration is counterbalance by the planar interface-induced aberration.

%In conclusion, the two tools we provided allow for accurate and efficient analysis of the focused volumetric field distribution. By sharing them to a broader community, it helps researchers and engineers to create and verify their new in-bulk processing ideas in a faster way.

\section*{Appendix A: Zernike standard coefficients of the single lens}
\setcounter{table}{0}
\renewcommand{\thetable}{A\arabic{table}}
This appendix lists the nonzero terms of the Zernike standard coefficients calculated at the exit pupil of the single lens LA1951-C and C240TME-C. For both lenses, the properties of the incident laser beams are the same, i.e., a wavelength of 1555 nm and a $1/e^2$ radius of 5.2 mm. The refractive index of the medium after the lens is 1.
